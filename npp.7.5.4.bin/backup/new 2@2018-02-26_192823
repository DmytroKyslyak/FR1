Thanks for Upgrading to FingerText0.5.60 (Alpha)
Please read this document if you are upgrading from previous versions.

Upgrading from 0.5.37 or above
Everything is compatible.

Upgrading from any version between 0.5.20 and 0.5.35
In version 0.5.60 after you triggered a option hotspot, you can use right/down arrow to move to next option, left/up arrow to move to previous option. Hit tab confirm the choice.

 Also the option hotspot is not delimited by |~| anymore, it's using is simplier |. So $[![(opt)ABC|DEF|GHI]!] will define an hotspot with 3 options.
Upgrading from any version between 0.5.0 and 0.5.18
All hotspots are now triggered from inside to outside, left to right. Therefore dynamic snippets that is created before 0.5.20 can behave differently in this version.

Upgrading from 0.4.15 or 0.4.16
If you want to use your snippets after you upgrade to 0.5.60, you can go to the config folder and move the FingerText.db3 file to the config\FingerText folder after update.
chain snippet is indicated by $[![(cha)]!] instead of $[![(chain)]!]

Upgrading from 0.4.4 or 0.4.11
If you want to use your snippets after you upgrade to 0.5.60, you can go to the config folder and move the FingerText.db3 file to the config\FingerText folder after update.

Upgrading from 0.4.1
If you want to use your snippets after you upgrade to 0.5.60, you can go to the %Notepad++ folder%\plugins\FingerText and get the old database file Snippets.db3. Rename is to FingerText.db3 and move it to the config\FingerText folder after update.

Upgrading from 0.3.5 or below
FingerText 0.3.5 or below use a 'one snippet per file' system to store snippets, which is not compatibile with current version. If you really have a lot of snippets created using these early version, please send your snippets to erinata@gmail.com. I will try my best to import them into the database in the current version.
